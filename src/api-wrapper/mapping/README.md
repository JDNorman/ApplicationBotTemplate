# IMPORTANT

Mapping is very important for handling an api. If you are using an api and getting data, it's very important to map values you might get from the api to values.

For this project we will be using the countriesnow api to get data about countries and we will decide how we arrange our data.

First we have to find every endpoint and figure out what we want to do with them all.

1. First we need to go to `api.ts` and make an empty object for all of our data.

The `index.ts` is where all of these mapped values are handled. You need to import your values from each file and handle them there. More instructions are in `index.ts`.
