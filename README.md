This is the repo for the Discord Bot Template, a Template for higher-level discord bots. This project is meant to be a utility/helper bot for any developers!

TemplateBot features two basic commands that are easy to edit and build upon, so you can easily change everything you want to make it how you like!

## Introduction

- This discord bot template was created as insporation from another project that has absolutely amazing file organization
- You can find this insporation at `helldivers-2/discord-bot`! The project is created by user @jgaribsin, and you can find him on discord at @theyodastream!

## Getting Started

### Step 1 - Discord Application Set Up

- First you need to create the application in the discord developer portal.
- Go to the `[Developer Portal (click)](https://discord.com/developers/applications)` and click "New Application" at the top right to set up a new application.
- Select your own name and accept the Terms of Service and Developer Policy!

- First notice your `APPLICATION ID` and your `PUBLIC KEY` on the `General Information` tab, we will need those later.
- Also notice the `Terms of Service URL` and the `Privacy Policy URL` text boxes - if your discord bot ever reaches 100 servers, you must have both.

- You might be interested in a User Install where a member can allow the application to access member accounts. If so, you may go to the `Installation` tab and check the `User Install` checkbox and hit save.

### Step 2 - Repository Set Up

- For our purposes, we will be using github and we will make our repo and clone it there.
- First go to github.com and login. Next select import a new repo.

- Use this link to clone this repo and name your repo whatever you want! [https://github.com/JDNorman/TemplateBot.git](https://github.com/JDNorman/TemplateBot.git)
- Confirm you want to import and wait for it to finish preparing the new repo.
- Now your Discord bot's repository is ready to begin editing, however first, we need to prepare every 3rd-party software we will be using.

### Step 3 - 3rd Party Software
